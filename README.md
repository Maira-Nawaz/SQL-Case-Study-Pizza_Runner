# Pizza Runner SQL Case Study

## Introduction

This case study explores a fictional startup, **Pizza Runner**, which combines the charm of 80s retro styling with on-demand pizza delivery. The goal is to help the founder, Danny, make data-driven decisions by designing and analyzing a relational database using **SQL**.

## Problem Statement

Danny's startup needs actionable insights into its order, delivery, and operational data. This project involves creating a structured database from scratch, inserting sample data, and answering real business questions to support future expansion and efficiency.

##  Key Objectives

* Create relational tables to represent customers, orders, pizzas, and runners.
* Populate the database with realistic sample data.
* Use SQL queries to analyze business performance and answer operational questions.

## Case Study Questions

1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
8. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
9. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
10. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## Database Schema

The following tables were created:

* `runners` – Information about delivery staff.
* `customer_orders` – Orders placed by customers.
* `runner_orders` – Delivery status and timestamps.
* `pizza_names` – Names of available pizza types.
* `pizza_recipes` – Recipe composition for each pizza.
* `pizza_toppings` – Details of each topping.

## Tools & Skills Used

* SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL syntax)
* Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
* Data Normalization
* Relational Database Design
* Analytical Thinking

##  Outcomes

This project not only helps in practicing core SQL concepts like **JOINs**, **GROUP BY**, **aggregations**, and **filtering**, but also simulates a real-world business analysis scenario.
